Rules window visibility not synchronized with toolbar button state
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you close the rules window manually, the toolbar button to toggle it's visibility is not updated.


Test Wormtail on Windows ME and other systems, if possible
----------------------------------------------------------
Make sure (or at least check) if it is working.


open file directly from drag&drop
---------------------------------
If a file is dragged into explorer OR loglist view, automatically add that file.

We can either do that in the same window, or, possible open a new instance. Or, possibly, use a context menu for right mouse button drag?


Number of lines currently preloaded by default after file open is hardcoded
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This should be a configuration option that also supports "load complete file", or at the very least a registry switch.

Support tabs

Save/Open highlight configurations
----------------------------------
Currently, use of the feature is pretty limited if you loose everything on a retart.

Highlighting: ability to change foreground colour
-------------------------------------------------
"ability to change foreground colour for more highlighting permutations"

As suggested by adnan.ullah@*.co.uk


When new lines are added/found, use fade-out effect to highlight them
---------------------------------------------------------------------
When a new line is added, highlight it (with the default highlight color?), and then quickly "fade out" (using alpha-channel transparency).

Might not work on older systems though.


Improve multiline display
-------------------------
Multiline feature currently sucks:

 * Breaks on empty lines
 * Changes line height of single line items (can differ depending on current font setting)
 * Might not work on 9x systems (disable, provide alternate?)
 * Text is aligned to top / not centered in node rect.
